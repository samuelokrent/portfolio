# Portfolio
This is a kind of web portfolio displaying projects from the course CS242 at UIUC, completed as part of an assignment for that same course.
It basically displays an interface for navigating my SVN repository, and provides commenting capabilities.

## Run it
First install node/npm, then run
```
npm install
node index.js <PORT_NUMBER>
```
Where PORT_NUMBER is the port you want to run the server on.
